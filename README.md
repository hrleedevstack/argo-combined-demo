# Argoproj - Application Delivery Platform

![argo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argoproj/master/docs/assets/argo.png)


Argoproj is a set of loosely coupled tools that aims to unleash to power of Kubernetes:

* Argo Workflows - container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
* Argo Events - The event-driven workflow automation framework
* Argo CD - Declarative continuous delivery for Kubernetes
* Argo Rollouts - Progressive delivery for Kubernetes

Each Argo sub-project is focused on a separate use-case and can be used independently. But together, Argo projects
complement each other and form a **powerful application delivery platform**.

## Demo

This repository demonstrates how Argo allows gluing disconnected open-source projects into a complex system that
solves real-world use cases, with zero code written.

We are going to build a web application consisting of multiple microservices as well as a background batch processing
system that leverages machine learning. The application allows users to upload an image, stores the photo in an
S3 compatible storage and produces a new image with highlighted faces on it using a pre-trained ML model.

## Components

Instead of building an application from scratch, we are going to leverage existing open-source projects and
the Argo projects to make them work together for profit:

* [minio](https://github.com/minio/minio) - Kubernetes native S3 compatible storage. Minio is going to store
user uploaded images and ML workflows outputs.
* [filestash](https://www.filestash.app/) - A modern web client for the storage of your choice. Filestash
allows user to upload an image and view processing results.
* [facedetect](https://www.thregr.org/~wavexx/software/facedetect/) - a simple face detector for batch processing.
The facedetect encapsulates the magic and produces an image with detected faces.
* [argo-workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) - workflow engine for Kubernetes. Argo Workflows orchestrates
steps requires to access uploaded image, process the image and store processing results.
* [argo-events](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events) - event-driven automation framework for Kubernetes.
Argo Events are watching for new images in the S3 storage and triggers the batch processing workflow.
* [argo-cd](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) - GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD
manages components listed above it the Kubernetes cluster and encapsulates both day one and day two operations.


## Let's do it

1. First of all we need a Kubernetes cluster. Nothing fancy is required here. Use your GKE, EKS cluster or just run
[minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) cluster on your laptop.
2. Install Argo CD. Follow the getting started instructions in Argo CD [documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/).
> TLDR:
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
3. Deploy the demo scenario using Argo CD, which in turn will spawn all required components in your K8s cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrleedevstack/argo-combined-demo/master/demo.yaml -n argocd
```
4. Check the components' status in Argo CD user interface.

## Try it

1. Navigate to the external IP address of `demo-filestash` service on port `9001` and upload an image using the
[filestash](https://www.filestash.app/) web user interface. Note: image file must have ".jpg" extension.
2. Use [argo workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) user interface to observe background processing process.
Workflows user interface is available via external IP address of `argo-server` service on port `2746`.

3. See image processing results in [filestash](https://www.filestash.app/) interface.
